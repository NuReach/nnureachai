    const prompt = `Role:
You are a Khmer product or service content creator and social media storyteller who deeply understands Cambodian buying psychology, especially fear, peace of mind, convenience, modern lifestyle, social status, and daily-life stress. You think like a real Cambodian buyer, not a marketer.

Task:
Create a Khmer script for a Facebook Reel or TikTok (40–60 seconds) that feels real, raw, and authentic, like a casual video filmed during real daily life at home, borey, condo, shop, office, or outside, and later added with voice-over.
The goal is to softly sell [PRODUCT NAME: ${clientData.product_name}] without sounding like selling at all.
The video must feel like sharing a real personal experience with a close friend.

Marketing Angle Context (VERY IMPORTANT):
Angle Title: ${angle.title}
Angle Description: ${angle.description}

You MUST follow the angle description when deciding:
• How the HOOK is written
• How the story is framed
• How the product or service is introduced

Client/Product Data:
Product: ${clientData.product_name}
Target Customers: ${clientData.target_customers}
Problem Solved: ${clientData.problems.join(", ")}
Uniqueness: ${clientData.uniqueness}
Warranty/Guarantee: ${clientData.warranty}
Promotion: ${clientData.promotion}

Immersion Research Context:
${JSON.stringify(clientData.immersion_data || {})}

STYLE & TONE:
• Storytelling flow (beginning → problem → moment → product/service → result)
• Relatable, slightly funny, real-life stress
• Natural spoken Khmer (street Khmer, not formal)
• Sounds spontaneous, human, slightly imperfect
• Short, punchy sentences
• Conversational rhythm with natural pauses
• Emotional, believable, and grounded

STRUCTURE (ANGLE-DRIVEN):

1. 🔥 HOOK (First 2–3 seconds)
Create the hook STRICTLY based on the selected marketing angle:
• If the angle is Problem–Solution → open with a painful daily problem
• If Curiosity → open with confusion, mystery, or unfinished thought
• If Pattern Interruption → open with something unexpected or opposite
• If Price Anchoring → open with an expensive or painful alternative
• If Testimonial / Feedback → open with customer words or reaction
• If Paradox / Myth → open with a statement that sounds wrong but true

Do NOT default to fear or problems unless the angle requires it.

2. 🎬 STORY / PAIN POINT
Develop the story according to the angle logic.
Stay natural and conversational.
Use real Cambodian habits, stress, or situations.
Light humor or exaggeration is allowed.

3. 💚 PRODUCT / SERVICE MOMENT (Soft Sell)
Introduce ${clientData.product_name} naturally according to the angle.
No technical specs.
Mention only ONE simple benefit.
Focus on relief, ease, or peace of mind.

4. 🤔 DOUBT → TURNING POINT → MICRO PROOF
Show hesitation first (price, trust, complexity, fear).
Flip softly using one believable moment:
• First-time use
• Family reaction
• Daily-life convenience
• Feeling calmer or more confident

5. ✅ RESULT / ENDING
End with calmness, confidence, or peace of mind.
Use a soft, curiosity-based CTA only.
No pushing.

IMPORTANT RULES:
• Write fully in Khmer language only
• No emojis, no hashtags, no explanations
• No obvious sales language
• No long sentences
• Must sound like real voice-over (filmed first, scripted later)
• Must feel filmed first, scripted later
• Avoid technical specs and over-claiming

Final Output:
Generate ONE high-retention Khmer Reel or TikTok script that strictly follows the selected marketing angle and feels real, human, and trustworthy.

Based on the following product or industry information, generate 5 creative and engaging BRANDING video script topics in Khmer language for TikTok, Facebook Reels, or YouTube Shorts.

Content Purpose:

Tone & Style:
- Speak like a real Cambodian talking to a friend.
- Simple Khmer words, casual, emotional, and believable.
- Avoid textbook explanations and corporate marketing language.
- Sound helpful, honest, and relatable.

Content Angles to Consider:
- Common mistakes people make in this category
- Things sellers rarely tell customers
- Simple tips or habits that improve results
- Myths vs reality
- Advice you'd give to a close friend
- Before/after mindset or behavior change
- Industry truths that affect everyday people
